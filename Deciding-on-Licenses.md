This is the core of license compliance. The different agents scan the source code based on stored text phrases. To understand more details check the explanation of the different agents. _to be linked_

These license findings must be checked, perhaps adapted and approved.

1. File in the folder structure
2. On the screen on bottom in the middle you find the legend. Sometimes it pretty big. This you can close with the button 'hide legend'.

* Go through all files with licenses: jumps to the next file with a license, found by the agents, no matter if it is concluded already or not.
* Go through all files without license and no clearing result: jumps to the next file with a license, found by the agents, but no conclusion of a license.
5. If a file occurs more often in the component, the decision of one file can be applied also for the other files. But please check if this can really applied for the other files with the same name.
6. Clearing Decision Type
* no license known: apply if there is no license in the file
* to be discussed: if there are open questions to be discussed

* do not use: if there is a license found which cannot used in the context of the project, please check 'do not use'
* non functional: It can be decided by the license compliance team to mark non functional files, which are not relevant in the specific use case and do not need a license decision.

## 3. Process to conclude a License

### 3.1. Open a file in your component on the 'Change Concluded License' Page (see above)

### 3.2. Main License
1. It is always good to find out the main license, for example in a Readme file or in publicly available information.

**Example: ** ZLIB
A Readme file is available:

![edit-file-2](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/7afd5d76-0f0c-42f5-b691-b4b79911f952)


2. Check the reference text

If you click on the link behind the different agent findings, they reference text is highlighted in the sourcecode itself.

The monk result is only 98 % because there is an additional character in the source code:

![edit-file-3](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/da46e215-88cd-4512-b940-378737d9055d)


### 3.3. Conclude a single license

Based on the result it is clear, that the main license is the zlib license.
Click on the star next to the license, mark 'identified license' and submit or click on the '>' next to the submit button, to continue with the next file.

![edit-file-4](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/bbfae349-c202-4d86-aea1-1813cebc01a0)

The star next to the license, makes this license the main license for the component.

## 4. Change found license

![file-edit-5](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/353f8505-cdea-4a6e-a52e-657c2dabd1ae)


In this file a reference text is mentioned in zlib.h. Please check this file. In this case also the zlib license is mentioned.

### 4.1. The zlib reference must be deleted with the red 'X':

![delete-license](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/3d26244f-c8ed-42d4-a4e9-bbdd2bf211e3)

After deselecting the license, the symbol changes to a green '+' in case you want to add the license again.

### 4.2. Add the correct license (here zlib license)

![add-license](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/dcd3688c-1b02-416d-abde-cb8e0f317893)


Click on 'User Decision' and search for the correct license. Press the green '+' to add the license and close the window.

![image](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/f7d636e1-4e5b-498b-965f-2a03a27fe9ec)

Now 2 licenses are visible, one selected (as a user decision) the other deselected.

## 5. Bulk Scan

If you want to add or/and delete a license for more files at once the Bulk Scan can be used.

![Bulk](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/34e2e522-c015-4008-aef4-0073d8a2cb2b)


Mark the relevant text, this can be also a part of the reference text, found by the agent. 

**Attention:** It is very important to reference to a text part which is really clearly referring to a specific license information and which also available in other files.

Click on 'Bulk Recognition'

If there are characters of comment symbols check 'Clean text' button.

![bulk-clean](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/5538fb55-02bc-45d9-88ed-7baf7167ceb6)

*** Remove a license:**

* Scope of the bulk: 
  * Scan the whole upload
  * Scan only current folder (sometimes the text reference is only valid in the current folder, e.g. with included dependencies which have another license.
* Ignore Conflicts: If there are other bulk scans, which refer to another license, this shall be ignored.
* Scan files with findings: not all files are scanned, but only the ones with agent findings.
* Ignore irrelevant files: all files which are marked as irrelevant are ignored
* Custom delimiters (???? to be explained)

Click on 'Schedule Bulk Scan' and the bulk job will be started.

## 6. Individual License Texts

OSS License texts or permission notices are usually standardized, but there are also individual license texts, which are not predefined in your system.

**Example:** 

* Here is a specific permission notice, which is not captured in the system. 
* The MIT-CMU-style license is not relevant and must be deleted.
* The Permission Notice can be used. 
* Both licenses have no license text.

Copy the whole text of the permission notice.

Anyhow the license text must be added here, so click on the 'Click to add' Button.

![add license text](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/e08e54e4-6ca1-4679-b4c8-27d937ce33b7)


* Add the text in the field. If the field is to small, open it on the right bottom corner.
* Use the 'Clean Text' Button to delete comment characters.
* Press 'OK'

![license-text-add](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/935e0093-d9f1-4f0f-ae4d-b93531c9ebdd)


The License Text is appearing in the overview:

![image](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/26ff3076-92da-4c7e-a761-3b72e8177ed3)

In the same way individual acknowledgements and comments can be added.

For acknowledgements please refer to _(to be linked)_


* 7. Add Acknowledgements

*** 7.1 Acknowledge for Apache License

Some Licenses need to have specific acknowledgements in the Readme.OSS (the file with all license compliance information).
This is for example the Apache-2.0 license, which wants to have the content of the notice file added as an acknowledgement.

![notice-file](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/d2d93a70-5d18-49cb-aab2-0e82ff539185)

* Click on Acknowledgement
* In case of Apache-2.0 click on 'Select from Notice File'. 

The content of the Notice file of the specific component will be selected and shown in the window. Click on 'use this' and cancel the appearance of the screen. 

![Uploading notice-content.pngâ€¦]()

The content of the notice file is added to the 'Enter Content' field and can be edited here. 
In this example the reference text to the license requirement should be deleted.

![image](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/b01cbca4-a06e-448a-9351-6f63c855e249)

In the 'Change concluded licenses view' the content of the notice file can be seen in the 'Acknowledgememt' field. If wanted a comment can also be added. This will not be printed in the Readme.OSS.

![ackn-comment](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/aa82ab08-829b-47e0-9018-3541440ced6d)

*** 7.3 Any other Acknowledgement

There are also other acknowledgements required, for example for using Dual or Triple Licenses.
Here you have to indicate, what options are given and which one you choose.

* Acknowledgements can just be entered in the field.
* Acknowledgements can be chosen from a list of acknowledgements you have created before:

![image](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/5466efd7-c810-4c56-9470-7b718929052d)
