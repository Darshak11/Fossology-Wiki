# 1. About
Shows the Readme.OSS with all licenses and copyrights of the actual FOSSology Version.

# 2. Debug
## 2.1 Debug Menus
Here full debug can be enabled an disabled: 

This developer tool lists all items in the menu structure. Since some menu inserts are conditional, not everything may appear here (the conditions may not lead to the insertion). Fully-debugged menus show the full menu path and order number in the menu.
The full debugging is restricted to your login session. (Nobody else will see it.)
Full debugging shows the full menu path for each menu and the order is included in parenthesis. However, menus that use HTML instead of text will not show the full path.
To disable full debugging, return here and unselect the option.

## 2.2 Debug Plugins
