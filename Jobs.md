The different jobs can be managed from the UI, all the details are logged for all the jobs.
Jobs run when uploading a component. Depending on your configuration, the agents process the source code. But also every bulk scan is a job.

All your jobs will be shown in that list. _How long are they stored ??_

Similarly, like managing your own jobs, you can manage all jobs from the groups you are part of. 
Like this you can see, what is running right now, from you as well as from your group. you may also manage decisions download reports etc..

In addition, the system load can be made visible top left corner in the Head bar. Then you may upload the big packages based on system load metrics. In addition information can be given in the head bar (e.g. maintenance work).

# 3. Schedule agents

Even after uploading components additional analysis can be done. The options are the same as upload page. For further details check in the section 'Uploading files'.
