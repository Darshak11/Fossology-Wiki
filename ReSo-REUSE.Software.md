# ReSo agent

`ReSo` stands for `REUSE.Software` - a set of recommendations about licensing a project. The standard assumes creating a `.license` file per each licensed file in the sources code. `ReSo` agent marks licensed files with a license found in the `.license` files (outside of the licensed files).

Extract of the specification: https://reuse.software/spec/#comment-headers
> If a file is not a plain text file or does not permit the inclusion of comments, the comment header that declares the fileâ€™s Copyright and Licensing Information SHOULD be in an adjacent file of the same name with the additional extension .license (example: cat.jpg.license if the original file is cat.jpg).

**Note:**
> *there are also other assumptions in the REUSE standard, that are not in the scope of the agent for the moment*

## Using the agent
1. User uploads source code with
    - `foobar.jpg` -> an image
    - `foobar.jpg.license` containing:
        ``` # SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2016, 2018-2019 Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
        # SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2019 Example Company
        #
        # SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
        ```
2. Select Upload options:
   - Select optional analysis 
       - REUSE.Software Analysis -> will also trigger a scan with Ojo agent
   - Automatic Concluded License Decider, based on
       - ... scanners matches if Ojo or REUSE.Software findings are no contradiction with other findings
2. Ojo agent detects licenses for file `foobar.jpg.license`
3. The ReSo agent detects the link between `foobar.jpg` and `foobar.jpg.license`, and applies the same license to `foobar.jpg`

Note:
- If an agent found a contradictory license for `foobar.jpg`, the decider does not change it, even if `foobar.jpg.license` was found (same behavior os Ojo agent)
- Checking ReSo agent will also trigger Ojo agent, even if it not selected when uploading


## How it works

ReSo agent assumes that the [[Ojo]] agent will detect the SPDX entries in `.license` files
The `reso` agent itself does not perform any scan on the upload content directly. 
It requires `Ojo License Analysis` to be executed before, which results are the data source for the `reso` agent. Therefore `ojo` execution is forced as a dependency agent before `reso`.

For the moment only manual upload with web UI have been tested, however other variants may also work properly. API upload support is yet to be implemented.

## Testing

Developments were tested against this [project example](data/reuse.software-02-v02.tgz)
