![upload-permissions](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/assets/9692764/16e643a0-f502-4a43-9433-655ea55c8404)
* First select the folder and the upload by name.
* You can also apply the same permission to all uploads of this folder.
* The public permission can be set??? here to different groups of users.
Possible permissions are: None, Read, Write, Admin and Clearing Admin
* Groups can be added in the list (last line of the table). 
??_ I do not understand: If the clearing for the upload is in progress or ready for your recent group, the reuser can copy these???_
* To understand who is part of which group, check it on the lower part of the page.

Please be aware, that there is no submit button, and changes are effective immediately.
